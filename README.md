# Data Visualization Comparison with Titanic Dataset

## Project Overview
This project compares three popular Python data visualization libraries—**Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly Express**—by creating similar visualizations using the **Titanic dataset**. The dataset contains details about passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, class, fare, and survival status.

## Objective
The aim of this project is to showcase the differences and strengths of each library in creating various visualizations. The visualizations included are:
- **Histogram of Age Distribution**
- **Scatter Plot (Age vs. Fare)**
- **Box Plot (Fare by Class)**

By comparing how each library handles these visualizations, the project highlights their capabilities in terms of:
- Ease of use
- Customization options
- Interactivity (Plotly Express)
- Aesthetic appeal

### Libraries Used
- **Matplotlib**: A foundational plotting library offering low-level control over visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Plotly Express**: A high-level interface for creating interactive plots with minimal code, ideal for data exploration.

## Features
- Compare **static** vs. **interactive** visualizations.
- Explore the strengths and weaknesses of each library through common chart types.
- Use the **Titanic dataset** to visualize real-world data.
